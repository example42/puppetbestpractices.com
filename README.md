# PuppetBestPractices.com

This is the source code to a crazy attempt to help others find their way as they use puppet. The goal is that this site will be a central place to get at the interesting articles and ideas within the puppet community.

## Running the site locally

The site is just a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) project. You should be able to install jekyll and run `jekyll build` to generate a copy of the site.

## Contributing

Issues have been created with notes about topics that it would be great to have articles on. While, in general, the goal is to link to external resources elsewhere in the community, a quick write up isn't a bad solution either. Please open a pull request to create new code.
