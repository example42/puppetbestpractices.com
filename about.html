  <h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>
  <p>At PuppetConf 2013 there was a discussion about best practices around Puppet that took place during the open sessions on Developer Day. The general theme seemed to be, "Oh, go read this article," or "go watch this video." Most of the things that many of us regarded as best practices had been written but there was no central place to direct people to to go find those resources. Thus, <a href="http://puppetbestpractices.com">puppetbestpractices.com</a> was born.</p>

  <h2>What is the goal of this site?</h2>
  <p> The whole reason this site exists is to aggregate the great thoughts in the Puppet community in one place. When there are not clear winners on a topic or varrying points of view, all should be presented. Ideally, the articles, videos, tools, etc. that are regularly referenced in discussions should be easily found on this site.</p>

  <h2>Contributing</h2>
  <p>The hope is that as time goes by this will be more of a community site than something that is maintained soley by <a href="http://twitter.com/cwebber">@cwebber</a>. Contributions are welcomed and can be done with a Pull Request at <a href="https://github.com/puppetbestpractices/puppetbestpractices.com">https://github.com/puppetbestpractices/puppetbestpractices.com</a>.
